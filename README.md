Eggs On Mars

Game for the 1st Corona Blitz - http://forums.coronalabs.com/forum/619-coronablitz/

Uses the movieclip module ( by Ansca back then, Corona Labs now ) and my own "library" - KendersLib ( added as a submodule on github ).

The game is about catching eggs using a rocket-basket. You have limited fuel and you can only move up and down! Don't break more then 2 eggs! 

Bon Apetite, scrambled egger!
